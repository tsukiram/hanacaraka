Key innovations such as the steam engine, mechanized textile production, and improved iron-making techniques fueled this transformation. Factories replaced cottage industries, leading to urbanization as people moved to cities for work. While the Revolution increased productivity and technological advancement, it also caused poor working conditions, child labor, and environmental pollution.",

Rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel symbiotic algae, leading to whitening and death. Ocean acidification, caused by increased CO₂ absorption, weakens coral skeletons. Reefs also face threats from pollution and overfishing. Despite their ecological importance—providing habitat for marine life and protecting coastlines—scientists warn that without intervention, most reefs could vanish by 2100.",

Using chlorophyll, they absorb light to transform carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process occurs in chloroplasts and is vital for life on Earth, as it produces oxygen and forms the base of the food chain. Factors like light intensity, temperature, and CO₂ levels affect photosynthesis rates.",

Economists predict that by 2030, over 50% of the global workforce will telecommute at least part-time, signaling a permanent shift in work culture.",

The Mongol Empire's unification of much of the Silk Road in the 13th century boosted safe travel, but the Black Death and the rise of maritime trade led to its decline.

For example, the 'confirmation bias' leads people to favor information that confirms their preexisting beliefs, while the 'sunk cost fallacy' makes them continue unprofitable endeavors due to prior investments. Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman demonstrated that humans rely on two systems: fast, intuitive thinking (System 1) and slow, logical analysis (System 2). Understanding these biases can improve financial, medical, and political decisions, yet overcoming them requires conscious effort.",
