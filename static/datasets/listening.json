First, you have some time to look at questions 1 to 5.\"\n\n\"Now listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 5.\"\nProfessor:\n\"Today, we'll discuss symbiosis—a close ecological relationship between organisms of different species. There are three main types: mutualism, where both benefit; commensalism, where one benefits without harming the other; and parasitism, where one benefits at the other's expense. A classic example of mutualism is the relationship between bees and flowers. Bees get nectar, while flowers get pollinated. In contrast, tapeworms in mammals represent parasitism. Understanding these interactions helps us evaluate ecosystem health.\"",

Three key factors drove this transformation: technological innovations like the steam engine, rapid population growth, and abundant access to coal as an energy source. As factories replaced traditional manual labor, production efficiency soared. However, this shift also led to unintended consequences, such as urban overcrowding, pollution, and harsh working conditions—often with 14-hour workdays and child labor. In response, the late 19th century saw the rise of labor movements advocating for workers' rights, including shorter hours and safer environments. These reforms laid the groundwork for modern labor laws.\"",

The textbook calls them both 'minor celestial bodies,' but they seem completely different...\"\nProfessor:\n\"That's an important distinction! Let me clarify: Asteroids are essentially rocky fragments, most orbiting in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter. Comets are icy bodies originating from the outer solar system - what astronomers call 'dirty snowballs' of frozen gases and dust.\"\nStudent:\n\"So when we see comets with bright tails, is that because of the ice?\"\nProfessor:\n\"Exactly right! As comets approach the sun, solar radiation vaporizes their ice, creating two distinct tails: a dust tail and an ion tail. That's why famous comets like Halley's or Hale-Bopp become so spectacular - their tails can stretch millions of kilometers!\"\nStudent:\n\"And asteroids never display this behavior?\"\nProfessor:\n\"Never. Without volatile ices, asteroids remain inert. They may collide and create debris fields - in fact, we think some meteor showers come from asteroid fragments - but you'll never see an asteroid with a glowing tail.\"",
