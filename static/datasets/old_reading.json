Key innovations such as the steam engine, mechanized textile production, and improved iron-making techniques fueled this transformation. Factories replaced cottage industries, leading to urbanization as people moved to cities for work. While the Revolution increased productivity and technological advancement, it also caused poor working conditions, child labor, and environmental pollution.",

Economists predict that by 2030, over 50% of the global workforce will telecommute at least part-time, signaling a permanent shift in work culture.",

The Mongol Empire's unification of much of the Silk Road in the 13th century boosted safe travel, but the Black Death and the rise of maritime trade led to its decline.

For example, the 'confirmation bias' leads people to favor information that confirms their preexisting beliefs, while the 'sunk cost fallacy' makes them continue unprofitable endeavors due to prior investments. Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman demonstrated that humans rely on two systems: fast, intuitive thinking (System 1) and slow, logical analysis (System 2). Understanding these biases can improve financial, medical, and political decisions, yet overcoming them requires conscious effort.",
