          "reading_passage": "Hydrogen cars are the best solution to replace fossil fuel vehicles. First, they emit only water, reducing air pollution. Second, hydrogen is abundant and can be produced from renewable energy. Finally, these cars have longer ranges than electric vehicles (EVs), making them practical for long trips. While hydrogen cars seem promising, they face significant challenges. First, producing hydrogen fuel requires massive energy, often from non-renewable sources, which contradicts the 'clean' claim. Second, hydrogen fueling stations are rare and expensive to build—currently, there are fewer than 100 in the U.S. Lastly, hydrogen is highly flammable, posing safety risks that EVs don't have. Thus, hydrogen cars may not be the ideal solution yet.",
